   <h2>Taco salad American dish</h2>
   <p>Taco salad is a dish that originated in the United States. It is not a traditional <br>
     Mexican dish but was inspired by Mexican cuisine. The exact origin and creator of the  <br>
     taco salad are not definitively known, but it is believed to have emerged in the mid-20th century. <br>
